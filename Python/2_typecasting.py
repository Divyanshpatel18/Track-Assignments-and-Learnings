# Typecasting in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another.
# Python provides several built-in functions for typecasting. Here are some commonly used ones:

# int(x): Converts x to an integer.
# float(x): Converts x to a floating-point number.
# str(x): Converts x to a string.
# list(x): Converts x to a list.
# tuple(x): Converts x to a tuple.
# set(x): Converts x to a set.
# dict(x): Converts x to a dictionary.

# EXPLICIT CONVERSION - DONE BY US 
# IMPLICIT CONVERSION - DONE BY PYTHON/
d=8
c=1.0
print(c+d)# the result will be typecasted into float
    
    
# a="1"
# b=1
# print(int(a)+b)

# ERROR
# a="harry"
# b=1
# print(int(a)+b)
